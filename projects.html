                <h2><br>Project APEX</h2>
                <a href="https://replit.com/@Casual_Tube/APEX#main.py"><img src="images/projects/apex.png" title="APEX" alt="Black screen that says welcome to Apex"></a>

                <p>
                    This is the first major program that I had wrote. Apex is a basic digital assistant, with a calculator, conversation bot (WIP), small games (WIP), and more.
                    This was written in Python and was last updated in spring of 2019. A Java port is currently in the works.

                <a href="https://replit.com/@Casual_Tube/Olympic-Citiy-Logo"><img src="images/projects/olympicLogo.png" title="Custom Japanese Olympic Flag" alt="A geometric focused, custom Japanese flag colored based on the olympic colors"></a>

                <p>
                    This project was made for high school advanced geometry. The original project asked for the student to draw an Olympic
                    logo for a country they choose and to include different geometric aspects (tangents on a circle, different angles, etc.)
                    I chose to do Japan, and asked the teacher if I could make a program to draw my logo instead of doing it by hand.
                    This was done in Python with the Turtle library. At this point, I had not has any experience with object oriented programing.
                    The code is messy, but I wanted to leave it in its original state.

                <a href="index.html"><img src="images/projects/honorsPage.png" title="Homepage" alt="Homepage of STEM Honors E-Portfolio"></a>

                <p>
                    The portfolio that is being viewed currently is one of my projects! This was a project for WEBD-101 at Franklin University during the Spring 2021
                    semester. This page was made from the ground level up, with HMTL, CSS, and a small bit of JavaScript and jQuery. One week at a time, the project was
                    built upon, which was finished by the last day of class (4/17/2021). Professor Waicheong Jefferylam helped answer questions when I wanted to tweak or change 
                    aspects of the pages that moved away from the requirements. The occasional moving away from the requirements was due to the purpose of the sites creation and use.
                    An example of this is the requirement to have one (1) CSS file, but multiple CSS files were permitted due to it fitting the purpose of the site better.
                </p>
