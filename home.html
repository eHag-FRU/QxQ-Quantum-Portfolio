                <h1>Introduction Letter</h1>
                <h2>Dear reader,</h2>
                <p>
                    This website contains my (Elliott Hager's) high school S.T.E.M honor's portfolio (<a href="http://education.ohio.gov/Topics/Ohio-s-Graduation-Requirements/Honors-Diplomas/STEM-Honors-Diploma">Requirements</a>). 
                    My area of focus is on software engineering, which I have learned about through the CCP program at Franklin
                    University. Starting out, I knew a small bit of Python, but now looking back I have learned  so much as a computer scientist and software engineer.
                    <strong><em>An extra portfolio is nested inside for a flex-credit course I took, <a href="https://www.qubitbyqubit.org/">Qubit x Quibit (QxQ)</a> Intro to Quantum Computing. This course is the first course in the world
                    that teaches high schoolers the basics of quantum computing and Qiskit. (Not yet finished or added)</em></strong> There are  four main areas: <a href="career.html">career</a>, <a href="projects.html">projects</a>, an <a href="aboutMe.html">about me</a> page, and a <a href="contactMe.html">contact me</a> page for questions. The career section will discuss
                    my future plans as a move closer to adulthood.  College applications, what types of jobs I would be looking for, and my resume are included.
                    The project section of the site will contain a few projects that I have done myself to show that I can apply the information and theories that I have
                    learned in classes. The following languages are what I have learned: Python, Java, SQL, Assembly (Little Man Computer), and Qiskit. The about me section of this 
                    contains the lists of courses I have taken (HS and college), a basic description of me, and a picture of myself.
                </p>
