                <h2>College Applications</h2>

                        <li>Texas A&amp;M - Deferred to a partner college <b>but computer science majors are not eligible</b></li>
                    </ul>

                </p>

                <br>

                <h2>Learning/Education Plan</h2>

                <p>
                    I am aiming to earn my associates of science in computer science at Franklin University by graduation (<a href="https://www.franklin.edu/degrees/associates/computer-science">Degree Details</a>). From there, I plan to attend a four-year institution.
                    My top two college choices are the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Iowa State University (ISU). My major would be software engineering, but I
                    am willing to go for a bachelor's and/or a master's in computer science focusing on software engineering. I have had the same career idea since I was in second or third grade
                    So you can say I am strong-willed and making it happen.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h2>Jobs</h2>

                <p>
                    <h3>The Design Scribe</h3>
                    Over the 2021 summer, I held a job at a small, local business called The Design Scribe. The business had been run out of the owner's home for seven years before getting a storefront in West Liberty.
                    The business did web design sold office supplies, printing, and graphic design. My employment was from May of 2021 to August of the same year. I was let go due to finical issues, but I am glad to work there. During my time at the job, I improved my people skills, communication, and teamwork with project deadlines.

                    <br><br>

                    During the period of employment, however, I did get put on two web design commissions. The commissions were not massive, but I got to work with Divi Builder and WordPress to update information for business in the hospitality industry.

                </p>

                <br>

                <h2>Plans During & After College</h2>

                <p>
                    During college, I want to intern at Pixar as part of their central software engineering team. I have enjoyed
                    their animated films and want to help out behind the scenes.

                    <br><br>

                    If there is a position open and I feel that my skills would benefit the team, I would apply for a full-time position.
                    Otherwise, I would look at a position with companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, or other companies I am
                    familiar with and use their software.
