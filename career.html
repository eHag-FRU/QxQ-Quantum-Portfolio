                    <h2>College Applications</h2>

                    <p>I currently do not have any college applications, but will soon once Senior year hits. I have already received a couple of scholarships on accident due to colleges
                        thinking I am a senior. It is a nice preview into what finical aid I could get, which is important to me so I do not put a finical burden on myself or my parents.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Learning/Education Plan</h2>

                    <p>I am aiming to earn my associates of science in computer science at Franklin University by graduation (<a href="https://www.franklin.edu/degrees/associates/computer-science">Degree Details</a>). From there I plan to attend a four-year institution.
    Currently my college top two are Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Ohio State University (OSU). My major would be software engineering, but I
    am willing to go for a bachelors and/or a masters in computer science with a focus in software engineering. I have had the same career idea since I was in second or third grade
    , so you can say I am strong willed and making it happen.
